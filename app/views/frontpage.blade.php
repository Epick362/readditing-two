			<p>Miss, can you place your bag in the tray please,” called the security guard from the other side of the metal detector.</p>

			<p>She jerked out of her trance and did what the guy asked. Slowly, as if her handbag contained a bomb. She went to step through the metal detector but the security guard stopped her. “Your belt will set off the alarm. Take it off.”</p>

			<p>She could feel herself blushing even though she hadn't done anything wrong. She supposed it was her body getting ready for what was about to come. </p>

			<p>After scanning her bag for illicit materials, they would stop her. For a second they would be unsure. Is that a bomb? But then they would realise. That's not a bomb. That's a dildo. They would let her go but it would already be too late. Her parents, waiting on the other side of the metal detector, would have seen the dildo.</p>

			<p>“Hurry up Gina” Claire said from behind. “I'm dying here.” She leant in and said in a lower voice “They aren't gonna do anything.”</p>

			<p>Gina turned around as she was taking off her belt and hissed “I know, I've just never done this before.”</p>

			<p>Claire poked her. “It's only a dildo.”</p>

			<p>Gina glanced upwards, locking eyes with the man waiting behind them. He was wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a faint-smile. He looked to be in his 40s.</p>

			<p>“Don't worry girls,” he said, “my wife brings her sex toys on cruises like this all the time.”</p>

			<p>Gina whipped back around and managed to take off her belt without fumbling too much, feeling her face go red. Suddenly going through the metal detector was the easiest course of action. As she stepped through, she heard Claire say “What the fuck old man. Mind your own business.” </p>

			<p>No alarms sounded, although she didn't really expect them too. She looked over at the guard who was checking her bags. She saw him pause, and the what-if part of her mind went to code red. Gina froze. The guard's eyes narrowed. He frowned at the screen in front of him. Then he scratched his nose and pushed the tray along.</p>

			<p>Gina let out a sigh of relief, grabbed her stuff, and went to put on her belt by her parents. She watched as Claire was pulled aside for a pat-down.</p>

			<p>“Claire is such a lovely girl,” Gina's mother said. “I wonder why they stopped her.”</p>

			<p>“Who knows mum.”</p>

			<p>There was a short pause and then: “Well, I'm so glad she's coming with us on this cruise.”</p>

			<p>Claire, through security, sidled up to them and said “I'm glad too Mrs. Stone. Thanks for inviting me.”</p>

			<p>Gina's parents picked up their hand luggage and started down the corridor leading towards The MS Thalasso, the great cruise ship which dominated the ocean by the security checkpoint.</p>

			<p>“I like your parents.” Claire said.</p>

			<p>“Yeah, and they love you too. Possibly more than they love me.” Gina turned away, scanning the room, the last dry-land she would stand on for a week.</p>

			<p>By the metal detector, being searched, was the man with the horn-rimmed glasses. He was staring at Gina. She wanted to look away but couldn't. Slowly, so she would definitely understand, he mouthed the words “Hey Sweetie.”</p>

			<hr>

			<p>Gina stared at the extravagant food on her plate, expecting the gravy to slosh along with the waves outside. But the Thalasso's huge mass kept it steady in the water, and there was no sign that Gina and her family and Claire were in a dining hall on a boat rather than in a mansion somewhere.</p>

			<p>“Could you pass the relish please?” said Gina's father.</p>

			<p>“Of course Mr. Stone.” said Claire, flashing a practised smile.</p>

			<p>As she passed the relish to Mr Stone, she glanced at Gina. When best-friends lock eyes, they can communicate almost telepathically. Somewhere down the line here though, something was lost in translation.</p>

			<p>Claire was trying to tell Gina: “Gosh, I'm fitting in with your family so well. It's like we're sisters.”</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, Gina was receiving: “I'm stealing your parents you bitch.”</p>

			<p>Gina said “I'm full,” and stood up. She ignored the protests of Claire and her parents, and headed out of the dining hall.</p>

			<p>If she hadn't been upset, and had been paying attention, she would have noticed the man with the horn-rimmed glasses notice her. He waited a few minutes then stood up, obvious in a red checked shirt surrounded in a sea of black-tie formal wear, and followed Gina out.</p>

			<p>By that time Gina was quite far from the dining-hall, one of three dining-halls on the Thalasso, and was quite lost. For although there were signs everywhere, Gina refused to see them, and the ship was thus like a maze to her.</p>

			<p>A few floors above her, the ship was structured like a 3 tiered shopping mall, but Gina was trying to find her room and was in a long but claustrophobic corridor, with cabins far ahead and to either side of her. The problem was that all these corridors looked the same. They reminded her of the corridors from the hotel from The Shining. She imagined herself getting lost here, doomed to haunt the belly of the ship for years to come.</p>

			<p>As Gina was fumbling with her keys outside a room that wasn't hers, the man rounded a corner and caught up with her.</p>

			<p>“Having trouble there?” He called.</p>

			<p>Gina dropped her keys and yelped. “You scared m-.” She stopped abruptly as she saw the man.</p>

			<p>As he walked towards her, he said “Gina is it? My name is Patrick.”</p>

			<p>“I'm fine sir. I don't need any help.”</p>

			<p>But that didn't stop Patrick. He kept walking until he was uncomfortably close to Gina, until she could smell his tangy aftershave.</p>

			<p>“Let me help you there.” He bent down and picked up her keys. “Aah, I can see the problem here. This isn't your room. You're on the wrong floor. Or should that be deck? I'm not quite sure. You get the idea.”</p>

			<p>Gina wished she was Claire then. Claire was the headstrong one, the one who would tell anyone where to go, whether they deserved it or not. She would have sworn at the man, or shouted at him, or both, and he would slink off.</p>

			<p>But Gina didn't swear or shout. She said “Can I have my keys back please?”</p>

			<p>“Of course you can Gina.” But Patrick didn't make any move to give Gina her keys back. Instead, he thumbed the huge room number tag. She could see the fingermarks he left in sweat on the plastic.</p>

			<p>Patrick continued. “My room is on this floor you know. 145.”</p>

			<p>Gina looked around for someone who could help her, but there was no one. This floor had of course been invited to dine in the same hall and at the same time as Gina's floor. She was alone.</p>

			<p>Patrick reached towards Gina's face, softly. Gina wanted to scream, but she couldn't do anything.</p>

			<p>When he tenderly grazed her cheek with his knuckle, the surprise shocked Gina into action. She bought her hand up, quick, into Patrick's face. The slap seemed to echo down the corridor as Patrick's head was swept to the side. She saw his cheek begin to glow red.</p>

			<p>“You bitch.” Patrick touched his cheek, checking for damage. “You fucking bitch. What did you do that for.” He went to grab her wrist, but she remembered what Claire had taught her about pervy men, and kicked him right in the balls.</p>

			<p>He doubled over, the air whooshing out of him. Her keys clattered to the floor, and she snatched them, and ran.</p>

			<p>“Come back here Gina.” He wheezed as loudly as he could, even though it hurt him to talk. “Gina. Gina. You'll be fucking sorry.”</p>

			<hr>

			<p>The air was salty, and painfully cold, but Gina was glad to be outside.</p>

			<p>She was stood leaning over the railings at the edge of the deck near the prow. She almost felt like Rose from Titanic, just less glamorous. If only the railings weren't walls, keeping her on the boat with Patrick.</p>

			<p>There was a pool behind her, and some sun loungers, but of course they weren't in use. It was late at night, although it wasn't dark thanks to the blinding floodlights. Her parents and Claire were probably still eating, unaware that anything had happened.</p>

			<p>Gina wasn't alone on the deck. There was a new couple nearby on the other side, huddled together to protect from the cold. She could occasionally hear snippets of lovers' conversation. It did nothing to improve her mood. She just stared into the black water, thinking.</p>

			<p>Soon, she realised someone was next to her. A woman, late 20s. She was dressed in grubby white overalls, and was smoking in a casual way that a girl of Gina's age couldn't help but find impossibly cool.</p>

			<p>Gina realised was staring at her. Damn.</p>

			<p>The woman turned. “Hello.” The cigarette stayed in her mouth while she talked, hanging like a man desperately hangs on to the edge of a skyscraper.</p>

			<p>“Hello.” said Gina.</p>

			<p>“What's your name?”</p>

			<p>“Gina.”</p>

			<p>“Nice to meet you Gina, I'm Sarah.” Sarah turned back to the sea and took a drag. Gina noticed Sarah wasn't shivering or hunched like she was. Sarah seemed immune to the cold.</p>

			<p>Gina realised she was still staring. Damn. She didn't know why the woman held her gaze so.</p>

			<p>“Gina, if you continue to stare at me like that, you're going to burn a hole right through me.”</p>

			<p>“Sorry Sarah.” Gina turned back to the sea.</p>

			<p>They stood in silence for a while.</p>

			<p>“So what's wrong?” said Sarah.</p>

			<p>“Nothing.”</p>

			<p>“I work in the kitchen.”</p>

			<p>“Oh.” A pause. “Are you allowed to smoke?”</p>

			<p>“Not in front of passengers, in uniform, but it's relaxing here.”</p>

			<p>“It is.”</p>

			<p>“You wanna see something cool?”</p>

			<p>“Sure.”</p>

			<hr>

			<p>And so Sarah took Gina down to the areas of the Thalasso that paying cruise-makers didn't usually see.</p>

			<p>It vaguely resembled a hospital. Gone was the carpet of the dining-hall. In its place, linoleum. Gina and Sarah's steps really did echo down the corridor, but it wasn't a lonely sound, for the corridor was full of people, all walking briskly, and their steps echoed too.</p>

			<p>As the pair walked, people kept waving and nodding and winking at Sarah, and Sarah kept waving and nodding and winking back.</p>

			<p>Nobody seemed to mind that Gina was there, and when Gina asked, Sarah said “It's cool. All these guys are cool. Most of the people that would mind are on shift right now. Don't worry, I'll look after you.”</p>

			<p>“Thanks.”</p>

			<p>And Gina started to wave and nod and wink along with Sarah, and as she realised she was safe from Patrick, she started to feel a little better.</p>

			<p>“So...” Sarah said, “What do you want to see?”</p>

			<p>“I'm not sure.”</p>

			<p>“Hmmm.” Sarah raised her eyebrows in a way that her friends recognised as “The Mad Idea-Brows”. “Come with me.”</p>

			<p>Sarah led Gina down some more corridors. The amount of other crew members around them slowly dwindled until it was just the two of them.</p>

			<p>“In here.”</p>

			<p>Sarah held open a door.</p>

			<p>Gina stepped into a small room that was almost entirely metallic. There was just enough room for an empty bed covered in white sheets. No pillow, no covers. Next to it was a small metal table with a couple of draws underneath. On the table were... implements.</p>

			<p>There were 3 small metal doors on one of the walls.</p>

			<p>“What is this place?” said Gina quietly.</p>

			<p>Sarah came in and closed the door, so Gina had her own little corner and Sarah blocked the door. “Cool isn't it? It's the morgue. Isn't it crazy that there's a morgue here.”</p>

			<p>“Yeah... crazy...” ...that you think this is cool, Gina thought. But, not wanting to disappoint Sarah, what she actually said was: “...so, are we allowed to be here?”</p>

			<p>“Oh definitely not, but no one's gonna find us. Who dies on a cruise?” Sarah put her hands on her hips and looked around proudly. There was a buzzing from Sarah's pocket. She pulled out a phone. “Oh shit... Gina, I've got to be somewhere. Will you be OK here for 5 minutes?”</p>

			<p>For the second time in as many days, the what-if part of Gina's mind went on red-alert. And, like the last time, Gina's automatic response was to freeze.</p>

			<p>“Cool,” said Sarah. “I'll literally be 5 minutes. Just hide in here, you'll be fine.”</p>

			<p>Sarah left the room, and just like that, Gina was alone in the Thalasso's morgue.</p>

			<p>The metallic room suddenly seemed even smaller. Gina could hear her heart pounding in her ears. She noticed some browish-red stains at the corner of the bed that surely were blood or shit. She looked at the 3 doors and couldn't help but wonder... Were there people behind them?</p>

			<p>Gina wanted nothing more than to get as far away from the morgue as possible, but she was trapped. Trapped because if she did leave the room, she would be lost. Trapped because if she did leave the room and was caught, she would be in big trouble. Trapped because even if she made it out of the crew area, she would still be on the ship with Patrick, and even though the Thalasso was huge, no matter how far she went the distance from her to the morgue would be measured in metres rather than miles.</p>

			<p>As she was fretting, the worst possible thing that could happen, happened.</p>

			<p>She heard voices outside the room.</p>

			<p>“Poor fella, had a heart attack right on the spot.”</p>

			<p>“Yeah, I heard. Bless him. Did you hear what Pete said?”</p>

			<p>“I didn't.”</p>

			<p>“The guy was going to propose. Told Pete to put the ring in the girl's champagne. His hand was in his pocket to get the thing and boom. Gone.”</p>

			<p>“Talk about unfinished business. Shit. Can you give me a hand with the door?”</p>

			<p>For a brief, brief moment, Gina thought about opening one of the small doors and climbing into the corpse space. But she didn't. And then the men came in.</p>

			<p>They were carrying another man between them. His face was twisted into a terrible grimace. His arms hung loosely by his sides. He was dead.</p>

			<p>He was dressed formally, and Gina wondered if he had been eating at the same place as her parents. She wondered if her parents had seen him die.</p>

			<p>The crewman who was carrying the dead man at the shoulder end saw Gina, and let go.</p>

			<p>The dead man's head flopped to the floor with a soft thud.</p>

			<p>“Shit! Who the fuck are you?”</p>

			<p>“What's going on?” said the guy who was at the feet end. He was still outside.</p>

			<p>“Well? Who are you?”</p>

			<p>Gina squeezed her eyes shut and willed herself not to cry. Crying was childish. Nevertheless, the tears poured out.</p>

			<p>“Jesus Christ.”</p>

			<p>“Ray, what the hell is going on.”</p>

			<p>“There's a girl here. What's your name huh?”</p>

			<p>Gina said “Sarah told me to stay here.” She opened her eyes, and saw recognition in the crewman's.</p>

			<p>"Sarah. For fucks sake. Listen girlie, I owe Sarah, so we're going to keep this quiet. Me and my friend are going to deal with this guy, and you are going to stay put and stay quiet. And then we're going to go and get Sarahy. And ten minutes later, when we come back to finish with this guy, you are going to be gone. Understand?”</p>

			<p>Gina nodded.</p>

			<p>“Ray this is bullshit.”</p>

			<p>“Yeah I know. I owe you one.” Ray shook his head, and picked up the dead man. The two crewmen then squeezed themselves and the corpse into the room.</p>

			<p>“You ready?”</p>

			<p>“Yup. One, two, three!” The pair heaved the corpse onto the bed.</p>

			<p>Ray looked at Gina again. “If anyone finds out about this we are going to be in all kinds of shit.” He turned back to the other crewman. “Let's go.”</p>

			<p>As they left the room, the other crewman said “You're damn right you owe me.”</p>

			<p>And Gina was once again alone. Well, almost. She looked at the corpse. Her stomach heaved; she had never seen a dead person in real life before. Just like they said, it wasn't like the movies.</p>

			<p>His head was flopped towards her. His furrowed brow made it look like he was angry.</p>

			<p>Out of morbid curiosity, she reached towards him, touched his face. His cheek was cold. Gina thought about his fiancée, so alone on this boat, unable to reach out to her friends or family until the cruise ended.</p>

			<p>Gina had an idea.</p>

			<p>She reached into the man's jacket, into the pocket. Her fingers closed around a small felt box. She pulled it out and looked inside. The engagement ring. She snapped the box shut and put in her own pocket.</p>

			<p>Was it her imagination or were the hairs on the back of her neck all standing up straight like soldiers? Were there bugs crawling across her arms? She felt a cold breeze on her face, which was surely impossible.</p>

			<p>But it was just the door opening and Sarah coming in. She took one look at Gina, whose face was still puffy from crying, and said “I'm so. Sorry.”</p>

			<p>Gina, overwhelmed, started crying again. Sarah opened her arms and Gina went to them. The pair hugged, and Gina told Sarah about Patrick, and her idea.</p>

			<p>Sarah said “Let's get out of here.”</p>

			<p>As they left, Gina looked back at the dead man for a final time and she got goosebumps all over again. And there it was. The cold breeze. Or maybe she was just imagining it.</p>

			<hr>

			<p>A day later, Gina was with her family and Claire in the dining-hall again.</p>

			<p>They were eating in silence when Sarah, dressed in her kitchen uniform, came to the table and slid a small note to Gina.</p>

			<p>“I..." Sarah looked at Gina's parents. "...did that thing that you asked. Good luck.” said Sarah.</p>

			<p>“Thanks.”</p>

			<p>And with that, Sarah walked off.</p>

			<p>“What's that?” Claire asked.</p>

			<p>“Who was that?” Gina's father asked.</p>

			<p>“Nothing, and nobody.”</p>

			<p>“Come on Gina,” said her mother. “You can't keep us in the dark about this.”</p>

			<p>After she finished her main course, Gina stood up to leave the room. Claire caught her at the door.</p>

			<p>“What are you doing Gina? Why don't you talk to me any more.”</p>

			<p>“It's just something I've got to do. I'll tell you about it later.”</p>

			<p>“Will you?”</p>

			<p>“I don't know Claire.”</p>

			<p>Claire stared at Gina, trying to receive something through best-friend telepathy. But she couldn't. “Be careful.” She let Gina go.</p>

			<p>Watching this exchange was Patrick. He was sitting alone, nursing a glass of red wine. When he saw Gina leave, he pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose, wiped his mouth delicately with a napkin, and slipped a knife into his pocket. He got up, and followed Gina out.</p>

			<p>Outside, Patrick looked down the corridor to either side of him. No one was around, but maybe 20 metres away, a door slammed shut. He jogged up to the door as quietly as he could, and went through.</p>

			<p>He was on one of the walkways that stretched the length of the ship. The wind whipped through his hair, lifting his frail comb-over to show his balding scalp.</p>

			<p>Footsteps below him.</p>

			<p>He craned his head over the rails, and saw Gina also leaning over the rails, a few levels below. He fingered the knife in his pocket.</p>

			<p>Gina opened the note. It flapped noisily in the wind. Room 290. She had already read it, but reading it again somehow steadied her nerves.</p>

			<p>She put the note away. 2 minutes, then she would deliver the news.</p>

			<p>The touch of a cold breeze crept across her back, so at odds with the ocean air buffeting around her. The hairs on the back of her neck stood up.</p>

			<p>Something told her to move, to duck.</p>

			<p>She followed her instinct, and dropped to the floor.</p>

			<p>A cutlery knife sparked off the rail above her. Holding the cutlery knife, breathing madly, Patrick.</p>

			<p>“What do you want from me!” screamed Gina, but he didn't hear. The wind was too loud. He could only see her mouth move.</p>

			<p>He let out a wordless grunt and brought the knife down again, but Gina rolled out of the way. </p>

			<p>Patrick lost grip of the knife and it went clattering into the water.</p>

			<p>He was still for a moment, then roared again. Gina was running down the walkway.</p>

			<p>He chased after her, easily caught her by her flapping jacket.</p>

			<p>He wrenched down, and she went sprawling to the ground.</p>

			<p>He picked her up, slammed her against the rails.</p>

			<p>The wind went out of her, but she had the strength to strike upwards with her knee. </p>

			<p>Patrick let go of her, and clutched the rail with one hand, his crotch with the other.</p>

			<p>“Not this time,” he said.</p>

			<p>But she stomped on his foot as hard as she could, and he flinched down, his head hitting the rail with a clang.</p>

			<p>He was down, moaning and rolling on the floor.</p>

			<p>She thought it was over, and started walking away.</p>

			<p>He grabbed her foot, but she managed to break away. She screamed and kicked him as hard as she could.</p>

			<p>He rolled away and she kicked him again.</p>

			<p>He rolled away again, under the rails and overboard, his screams instantly muted as he was enveloped by the ocean.</p>

			<p>Gina sat down, panting. This time, she didn't cry.</p>

			<hr>

			<p>There was a knock on the door. Amy had been laying on the bed fully clothed for about 18 hours now. She ignored the knock.</p>

			<p>The knocking continued, and Amy forced herself to get up. She looked at herself in the mirror as she went to the door. Her face was covered in mascara. She looked at the bed. The pillows were covered in mascara too. Oops.</p>

			<p>She opened the door to a teenager. 16, maybe 17. The teenager's hair was windswept to the say the absolute least, and her face was bruised.</p>

			<p>“Hello,” Amy said.</p>

			<p>“Hello,” replied the teenager. “You don't know me, but I have something that was meant to be yours.” She pulled out a small velvet box from a pocket. “I'm not sure how much it means now, but here you go.”</p>

			<p>Amy took the box. Opened it up. An opal engagement ring. She put her hand to her breast, then to her mouth. She was crying again, and she didn't know if they were happy tears or sad tears.</p>

			<p>She looked up, to say thank you, but the girl was already half way down the corridor. “Thank you,” she said anyway.</p>

			<p>As she closed the door, she felt the hairs on the back of her neck tingle, and a cold breeze swept by for the last time.</p>
